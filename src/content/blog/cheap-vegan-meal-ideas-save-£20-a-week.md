**Discover how to mix and match store prices with Cheapify.app for budget-friendly plant-based meals.**

---

Eating vegan doesn’t have to mean spending more on fancy health foods or trekking between specialty stores. In fact, with the right approach, you can enjoy delicious, nutrient-rich, plant-based meals for a fraction of the price most people expect.

The trick? It’s all about **knowing where to buy each item**—and that’s exactly where **Cheapify.app** comes in. By comparing prices across multiple UK supermarkets, you can mix and match your grocery list for maximum savings.

In this guide, we’ll show you:

* How to cut your weekly grocery bill by £20 without sacrificing taste or nutrition.
* Easy **cheap vegan meal ideas** that fit any budget.
* How to use Cheapify.app to become a plant-based budget pro.

Let’s get you saving money while eating better than ever.

## Why Vegan Meals Can Actually Be Cheaper

There’s a myth that going vegan is expensive—mainly because of pricey meat substitutes, imported superfoods, or “health store” branding. But the foundation of a plant-based diet—**beans, lentils, whole grains, seasonal vegetables, and fruits**—is some of the most affordable food you can buy.

For example:

* **1kg dried lentils** can cost as little as £1.60 and make 6–8 hearty meals.
* **A bag of oats** for £1.20 can provide breakfasts for two weeks.
* **Seasonal vegetables** (think carrots, potatoes, cabbage) can cost under £1 per kilo.

The challenge is that prices vary dramatically between stores. A tin of chickpeas could be 39p in one supermarket and 75p in another. Multiply that difference across a 20-item shopping list, and you could be overpaying £10–£20 every single week.

This is where Cheapify.app’s **smart grocery price comparison** comes in.

Cheapify.app takes your grocery list and instantly shows you the **cheapest combination of stores** to buy everything from.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Add your grocery list** – Enter your weekly items or pick from suggested vegan staples.

4. **Save or adjust your list** – If you’re flexible, swap items for even cheaper alternatives.

For example, a week’s worth of plant-based groceries might cost **£48 buying everything from one store**. But by following Cheapify’s suggestions and picking certain items from cheaper stores, you could pay **£28–£32 instead**—a saving of up to £20 per week.
