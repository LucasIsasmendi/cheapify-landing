**How to create delicious meat-free meals for under £2 per serving with store-smart shopping.**

---

Who says budget-friendly meals have to be bland or boring? Going meat-free doesn’t just save money—it opens the door to a world of flavours, textures, and satisfying dishes that can rival any restaurant plate.

The real challenge isn’t taste—it’s price. In the UK, the same ingredients can vary wildly in cost depending on where you buy them. Without realising it, you could be paying 30–50% more than you need to for everyday items.

That’s where **Cheapify.app** comes in. By comparing prices across UK supermarkets, it helps you find the best deals on all your grocery items—so you can create **cheap meatless recipes** that taste like a treat, all for under £2 per serving.

## Why Meatless Meals Are a Budget Win

Meat and fish are often the most expensive part of any shopping bill. Removing them opens the door to cheaper protein sources like:

* Lentils
* Chickpeas
* Black beans
* Tofu
* Tempeh
* Nuts and seeds

These aren’t just affordable—they’re nutrient-rich and versatile. Combined with seasonal vegetables, herbs, and spices, they form the backbone of a cost-effective, flavour-packed menu.

But the real secret to staying under £2 per portion? **Buy each ingredient from the cheapest store.**

---
