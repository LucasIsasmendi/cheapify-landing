**Quick, healthy dishes that cost less when you know which store to buy from.**

---

When life gets busy, cooking healthy plant-based meals can feel like just another item on an already overflowing to-do list. Add to that the rising cost of groceries in the UK, and it’s easy to see why so many people think eating well is expensive or time-consuming.

The truth is, you don’t need hours in the kitchen or a huge budget to eat delicious vegan food. In fact, with the right approach, you can whip up **cheap veggie dishes** in under 30 minutes—and save money while doing it.

The secret? **Shop smart.** Knowing which supermarket has the best deal on each ingredient can knock pounds off your grocery bill every week. And that’s exactly what **Cheapify.app** is designed to help you do.

## Why Store Choice Matters for Budget Cooking

Most people shop at one supermarket out of habit. But prices for the exact same product can vary massively between stores. For example:

* **Chickpeas (400g tin)** – 39p at Aldi, 75p at Tesco
* **Bananas (per kg)** – 69p at Lidl, £1.05 at Sainsbury’s
* **Oats (1kg)** – £1.20 at Morrisons, £1.65 at Tesco

If you’re buying 20–30 items for the week, those small differences add up fast. **Cheapify.app** takes your grocery list, checks prices across UK supermarkets, and tells you exactly where to buy each item for the lowest cost.

That means you can make your favourite **cheap veggie dishes** for even less—without having to manually compare prices or guess where to shop.
